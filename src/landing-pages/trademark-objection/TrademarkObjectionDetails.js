          <p>
            After filing an application for trademark registration, an objection
            is one of the initial stages after the registration process. The
            trademark officials examine and analyse the application and the mark
            and carry out their own search. After conducting their search they
            write down their opinions about the mark, mainly point out the
            reasons why the applied mark shall not be registered and may file an
            objection under Section(s) 9, 11 and 12 of the Act on primarily two
            grounds. All these objections along with relevant trademark
            provisions are stated in Trademark Examination Report.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              If the application contains incomplete/wrong information ;or
            </li>
            <li>If there is already a similar trademark(s) in existence.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            There are two ways where a third party gets a chance to object to
            the registration of a trademark.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>When the mark is published the Trademark Journal or,</li>
            <li>When the third party uses the similar or identical mark.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Upon filing an objection, the status of the application will change
            to “Opposed”. While filing an opposition the person opposing it must
            include the grounds upon which he is opposing the registration of
            the trademark. The examiner will provide the applicant an
            opportunity to defend and put his application as per the rules under
            the Trademark Act.

            qualifications under the Act, existing similarity with prior
            existing trademark registrations, and it may also related to

                An affidavit of Usage along with supporting documents could also
                be filed along with the reply to the examination report which
                shows that the trademark has acquired distinctiveness and is
                being associated with the goods/services of the applicant due to
                its prolonged usage.

            Filing of a correct and specific reply is pertinent step to secure
            trademark registration in India. In case, the objections are not
            being answered to the satisfaction of the trade mark office through
            the response submitted to them, the applicant can avail an
            opportunity of hearing before the Trademark Registrar, where he/she
            can present submissions orally.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hearing is generally conducted by the Assistant Registrar or
            Senior Examiners of Trade marks. The applicant of the trademark can
            also represent his/her case by hiring an attorney for drafting a
            reply as they are better experienced with relevant trademark laws
            and case laws that are pertinent to file the reply efficiently.
          </p>
          <p>
            In case, an applicant or his/her agent satisfies the objections of
            the Trademark Office via response or hearing, the examiner or
            assistant registrar, whoever has heard the matter, orders the
            publication/advertisement of the Trademark in the Trademark Journal.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a mark is accepted during examination, and no objection has been
            raised the trademark office will issue an acceptance order and the
            trademark will be published in the journal.
