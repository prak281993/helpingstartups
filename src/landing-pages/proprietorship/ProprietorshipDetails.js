            Sole Proprietorship firms are one of the most commonly seen and
            easiest form of business done in India as it is not governed by any
            specific law which is owned, managed and controlled by a single
            person and referred as Unorganized form of business.

            There is nothing like proprietorship registration on paper; but it
            can be recognized under the various registrations of government
            departments based on the business set-up and category. Being the
            sole owner of the business the individual enjoys all the profits and
            gains of the business and along with this he is the only person who
            is personally liable for the debts and liabilities of the business.
